## Story Instructions
You are an adventurer standing in the center of a map facing North, and youâ€™re trying to weave through the terrain to your final destination. You have the directions to your destination indicating the number of steps and the direction to travel.

Adventurer Path & Instructions - [./Adventurer Path.md](./Adventurer%20Path.md)

Given the Path Instructions above, programmatically parse the instructions and determine what is the Euclidean (straight line) distance from your starting point to the destination in steps?

**Tech Notes:**
- Use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like.
- Provide any needed instructions to run program.
- Do not round to the nearest step.
- After program executes the answer should be returned.
